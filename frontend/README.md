# Data-Structure

This Vite project was created for a college Skill-X presentation, but I decided to make it realistic and host it.

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate various data structures using Vite.js, Tailwind CSS, React Router. Contributions are welcome! If you have new ideas or improvements, please feel free to share them with me.

1. #### `public/:`

This directory contains static files that will be served as it is. The data.png file is an example of an image that the project uses. Files placed here will be accessible directly from the root URL of your application.

2. #### `src/:`

This is where your source code resides.

  - **components/**: Reusable UI components of your application. For instance, Navbar.jsx might contain the code for the header component used across multiple pages.

  - **routes/**: Each .vue or .jsx file inside this directory represents a different page or route in your application. For example, Home.vue might be the component for the home page.

3. #### `.gitignore:` 

This file specifies files and directories that Git should ignore. For example, you might ignore node_modules/ directory to avoid pushing dependencies to github or version control system.

4. #### `package.json:`

The configuration file for your project. It includes metadata about the project and a list of dependencies (node packages) required for the project.

5. #### `README.md:`

The README file provides information about your project, including how to set it up, contribute, and any other important details.
