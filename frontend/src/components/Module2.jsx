            <strong>Databases:</strong> Data structures like B-trees and hash tables are fundamental components of databases. They enable efficient storage and retrieval of data, indexing, and querying.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File Systems:</strong> File systems utilize data structures such as directory trees, linked lists, and hash tables to organize and manage files, directories, and metadata.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Data structures like caches (e.g., LRU cache) are used to store recently visited web pages, improving the performance of web browsers by reducing network requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Networks:</strong> Graph data structures are used to represent social networks, with users as nodes and connections as edges. They facilitate friend suggestions, finding mutual connections, and identifying network patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Routing Algorithms:</strong> Data structures like graphs and trees are utilized in routing algorithms for network communication, determining the shortest or fastest path between network nodes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Image Processing:</strong> Data structures like matrices and multidimensional arrays are used in image processing algorithms for storing and manipulating pixel data, performing operations such as filtering, transformation, and compression.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compiler Design:</strong> Data structures like symbol tables, parse trees, and abstract syntax trees are used in compiler design to analyze and transform source code during the compilation process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Data structures play a crucial role in various AI applications. For instance, decision trees are used in decision-making algorithms, and priority queues are utilized in search algorithms like A*.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Geographic Information Systems (GIS):</strong> GIS applications employ data structures such as spatial trees (e.g., Quadtree, R-tree) to efficiently store and query spatial data, enabling operations like map overlays and spatial analysis.
